Behind all the glamor and glitter of the stage, the BTS members have cultivated their own distinct fashion senses, as unique as each of the seven guys themselves. Delving into airport fashion, V Live looks, daily outfit tweets, and more, let’s decode the BTS members’ individual styles!</p>

          <p>Starting with the oldest member, Jin’s fashion tends to be clean-cut and put-together, for dignified looks that are befitting of the eldest hyung. He likes clothing with simple designs, which makes for elegant outfits that accentuate his model-like figure. Jin’s taste is also high-end: he has expressed a love of the luxury fashion brand Givenchy!</p>

          <h2>RM</h2>
		  <h3> Street with a twist</h3>
          <p>RM’s style has evolved a lot over the years, with the common thread of trying unique looks and putting various pieces together in bold ways. Just like his multifaceted personality, his fashion sense is hard to categorize, as it encompasses everything from streetwear to softer, almost boho looks. RM has expressed a love of Japanese streetwear labels such as WTAPS, Neighborhood, and Yamamoto, and recently he has been sporting a lot of Visvim</p>

          <h2>Suga</h2>
		  <h3> Straightforward style</h3>
          <p>Suga likes to keep it comfortable, favoring clothing that is oversized and cozy. His style is a unique mix of brands: while he loves Japanese streetwear brands such as Visvim and Mastermind Japan (his favorite), he can often be found sporting bags, shoes, and accessories from high fashion designers such as Gucci, Balenciaga, and Cartier. True to his generally chill personality, Suga tends to stick to a muted color palette in his clothing.</p>

          <p>Comfort meets high-end fashion in V’s wardrobe, which can pretty much be summed up in one word: Gucci. V is often dressed head-to-toe in the designer brand.Aside from his love of the Italian designer, V probably has the most clearly defined style among the BTS members: his outfits themselves are usually a variation on wide, flowing black pants paired with button-down dress shirts featuring vivid patterns in bold colors.</p>
